# Twil-Flare Travels: AI-Powered Travel Agent
*Hackathon Project Proposal*

## 30-Second Pitch

"Imagine texting your itinerary to an AI and getting instant travel updates, reminders, and actions—without downloading an app. Meet *Twil-Flare Travels*, a **fully autonomous travel assistant** powered by Cloudflare's edge computing, Twilio's communication platform, OpenAI's intelligence, and Unstructured's document parsing. Whether you need a last-minute weather check, flight delay info, or a reminder to pack your passport, *Twil-Flare Travels* is your **always-on travel companion**."

Users simply text a travel document to our number, then ask questions like *"What's my flight number?"* or take actions like *"Check if my flight is delayed"* and get near-instant responses (100-200ms) via SMS. No apps to download, no accounts to create—just text and go.

## Key Agent Capabilities

1. **Document Processing**: Autonomously extracts structured data from travel documents
2. **Natural Language Understanding**: Interprets complex travel queries
3. **Proactive Monitoring**: Sends timely alerts about upcoming travel events
4. **Action Execution**: Performs useful travel-related tasks on user's behalf
5. **Contextual Memory**: Maintains trip details and user preferences

## Interactive Demo Experience

### QR Code Access
- Presentation includes QR code linking to our Twilio phone number
- Judges scan with their phones to interact with Twil-Flare Travels directly
- We provide sample PDFs for judges to forward to the number
- *Fallback*: Pre-loaded demos in case of connectivity issues

### Basic Interaction Flow
1. **Judge texts a PDF itinerary** to our Twilio number (scanned from QR code)
2. **Twil-Flare Travels** confirms receipt: "Processing your travel documents..." (response in <200ms)
3. **Cloudflare Worker** processes the PDF via Unstructured API (runs at the edge)
4. **Twil-Flare Travels** confirms: "I've saved your itinerary for JFK→LAX on March 5-8"
5. **Judge asks**: "What's my hotel address?"
6. **Twil-Flare Travels responds**: "You're staying at the Hilton LAX: 5711 W Century Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90045"

### Proactive Alerts
1. **Day before flight**: "Your flight AA123 to LAX departs tomorrow at 9:45am. Weather looks clear for departure."
2. **Morning of flight**: "Your flight AA123 is on time. Traffic to JFK is heavy - consider leaving 30 minutes earlier."
3. **After landing**: "Welcome to LA! Your hotel is 5.2 miles from LAX. Rideshare to Hilton LAX costs approximately $25."

### Action Execution
1. **Judge asks**: "Check if my flight is delayed"
2. **Twil-Flare Travels**: "Checking flight AA123... It's currently on time departing at 9:45am"
3. **Judge requests**: "Remind me to pack my charger tonight"
4. **Twil-Flare Travels**: "I'll remind you about your charger at 8pm tonight"
5. **Judge asks**: "What's the weather forecast for LA during my trip?"
6. **Twil-Flare Travels**: "Checking forecast for Los Angeles, March 5-8... Expect sunny weather with highs of 75-80°F and lows of 58-62°F."

### Emergency Mode
1. **Judge texts**: "HELP"
2. **Twil-Flare Travels**: "*PRIORITY ALERT*: I'm checking all your upcoming travel components for issues..."
3. **Twil-Flare Travels**: "Your flight AA123 has been *CANCELED*. Alternative options: AA456 (10:30am) or AA789 (1:15pm). Reply '1' or '2' to investigate options."
